## Description

This is a assigment where we have been asked to modify the html and css

## Acceptance Criteria

- You’re tasked to modify the provided web project (HTML and CSS), based on the below exercises;
- Few things to consider:
- You’re not allowed to modify the original CSS ( css/style.css ). Instead create a new CSS file that contains
  your overrides,
- You’re free to modify the HTML,
- You’re not allowed to use Javascript to solve any task.

## Exercise 1

- Add a new hero section.
- The current website contains one hero section that shows an image of the moon. You’re tasked to add a new   section for space exploration. The new section needs to fit next to the current one instead of on top of it. On mobile, the sections should stack on top of each other.

## Exercise 2

- Fix the order of the timeline.
- The current timeline has the correct order in the HTML but it shows differently on the screen. You need to modify the HTML and CSS to make sure the order is correct (by ascending date) on all screen sizes.
- On Large viewports
1 2
3 4
5 6
- On Small viewports
1
2
3
4
5
6

## Exercise 3

- The current gallery uses the new CSS grid to position the items. Since we want to support older browsers, you’re tasked to override the grid code and use floats, flex, or similar solutions. Make sure that the gallery will keep same structure and behavior on all viewports.
